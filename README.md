# ProjectX
All-in-one, undetected CSGO cheat written in Python.
The cheat includes triggerbot, wallhack and autobunnyhop and is fully undetected by VAC. It comes with a nice Gui and can be installed very easily.
Requires Python3 and pip (aswell as CSGO obviously)

## Getting Started:

Step 1:
```
Download Zip File or git clone the repository and unpack the files if needed.
```

Step 2:
```
If installing for the first:
  1. Open a cmd as administrator
  2. Cd into the directory of the cheat
  3. use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required libraries
 ```
 
Step 3:
```
Open CSGO and start a match
```

Step 4:
```
Run the ProjectX.py file from the cmd (preferably as an administrator)
```

Step 5:
```
Select your desired settings and click "UPDATE"
```

## Notes
The cheat has its flaws and sometimes crashes but most of the times problems can be fixed with a restart.
Remember to update the offsets.py file if theres a new csgo update. I will provide the new file as soon as i have the time too but you can also get the offsets from the hazedumper github (https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper) or update them yourself.
